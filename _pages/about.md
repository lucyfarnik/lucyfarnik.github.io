I'm an ML PhD student at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cdt/interactive-ai/) researching robustness and continual learning in LLM agents under [Laurence Aitchison](https://www.laurenceai.com/).

I started coding at age 7 and by age 18 I was a senior dev at a startup.
After a few years working there, I decided to switch to ML research.
During undergrad I collaborated with researchers from [Oxford](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/), [Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/), and [FAR AI](https://far.ai/).
I then did [ARENA](https://www.arena.education/), [MATS](https://www.matsprogram.org/) (mentored by Neel Nanda from [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/)), and lots of other research placements.
I've also received over $100k in research grants and I cofounded a small research org working on AI security and emerging tech policy.

I've published at ICLR/ICML in areas ranging from [RL theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.15257) to [LLM interpretability](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18147).
Most recently, I'm excited about ways that LLM agents can effectively learn from their open-ended interactions with their environment, and how we can ensure that the things they're learning are aligned with what we want.

I'm always excited to meet new people with similar research interests -- do feel free to reach out! :)
